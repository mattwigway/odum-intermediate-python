    "# Base Python principles\n",
    "\n",
    "In the introduction to Python class, we learned about using the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries, but didn't learn much about the syntax of Python itself. In particular, all of the notebooks we ran in Introduction to Python were _linear_: Python executed the lines of code in order from top to bottom, without repeating or skipping any. In larger projects, it is often desirable to have _non-linear control flow_, where the lines are not executed in order—some may be repeated, some may be executed in a place other than where they were written, and some may be skipped altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, this would seem to make writing code much more complicated—and in some ways it does. But it also makes code simpler in many cases. For instance, you might need to apply the same calculation many times to different columns, or different values; using nonlinear control flow allows you to do this without duplicating code. You might want a notebook to work on multiple data files (for instance, one notebook that produces quarterly reports should be able to handle data from any quarter, just by changing the files it reads). This might imply some special cases with code that should only be executed in certain circumstances. Both of these allow you to follow the common programming idiom \"Don't Repeat Yourself\"—i.e. don't have the same or very similar code repeated throughout the project. The main reason for this is maintenance. Suppose you had some aggregation that you used throughout your analysis, and decide to change it—if it's coded in a bunch of different places, you have to find and fix them all, which could lead to errors or omissions. If that code is written once, you only have to fix it once.\n",

    "We are not importing pandas here, since we will be learning about built-in functionality of Python. We are importing a few built in libraries that come with Python."

    "The first tool for non-linear control flow we will be talking about is the conditional or if statement. This statement executes the following code only if the condition specified in the statement is true. For instance, the following code cell will run only if the seconds component of the current time is less than 30. Run it several times, until the output changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this cell, we also see the first use of an _indented block_. Notice that the `print` line is indented from the left margin. This signals to Python that this line is part of the body of the if statement - i.e. it should be executed based on whether the current second is less than 30. Any number of lines below the if statement may be indented, and blank lines and comments may be included. The body of the if statement ends at the first non-blank, non-comment line that is not indented.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're familiar with other programming languages, you've likely seen indentation used like this before. In most programming languages, this is a stylistic choice. It makes the code easier to read, but does not affect what it does. However, in Python, the indentation actually affects what the code does, because it determines which lines of code make up the body of a particular section of the code."

Functions can optionally take one or more _arguments_, which affect how they work, and they _return_ a value. They work just like functions in math, which operate on some input and evaluate to some output. We've been using functions since we started using Python - for example, `read_csv`, `sum`, `print`, etc. are all functions. Now we'll learn to create our own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions allow you to write code once and re-use it, rather than having the same or similar code all over the place in your notebooks. They even allow you to move your code out of your noteboooks and into shared files. And they allow you to write automated tests to help ensure your analysis is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the `def` (define) statment is used to create a function. It is followed by the name of the function, and the arguments in parentheses. An indented block follows which defines the _body_ of the function - the code that will be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you define a function, the code is not executed. Rather, it is stored, and is executed later, when you _call_ the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define a function that computes the Collatz conjecture for any starting point - the starting point will be an argment to the function."
