# Odum Intermediate Python: Part 1

This repository contains the exercises we'll be doing in part 1 of the [Odum Institute](https://odum.unc.edu) Intermediate Python class. It covers some recap of tabular data manipulation, along with more advanced tabular data manipulation, as well as Python built in language features and control flow, such as loops and conditionals.

To download the exercises, click "Code" in the top right, then "Download ZIP". If you are familiar with Git/Github, you're welcome to download by cloning the repository as well.

The [slides are available here](https://projects.indicatrix.org/odum-intermediate/).
